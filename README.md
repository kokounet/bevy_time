# Bevy Time

## Disclaimer

This is **NOT** an official repo of the [bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).
This repository is made in order to explore how could a refactor look like for `Timer` in bevy and how we can extend the feature to `Cooldown` and `Stopwatch`.

This repo is made in reaction to [this issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1127).
